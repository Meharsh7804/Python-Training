        "1.  **Class**: A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the attributes (data) and methods (functions) that objects of that class will have.\n",
        "2.  **Object**: An object is an instance of a class. It is a concrete entity based on the blueprint defined by the class.\n",
        "3.  **Attributes**: Attributes are variables that store data within a class or object.\n",
        "4.  **Methods**: Methods are functions defined within a class that perform actions on the object's data."
